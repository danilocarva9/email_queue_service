queue:work should be preferred when you want your queue's to run as a daemon. This would be a long-lived process that would be beneficial where performance was an issue. This will use a cached version of the application and does not re-bootstrap the application every time a job is processed.

queue:listen should be used when you don't care about performance or you don't want to have to restart the queue after making changes to the code.

The queue:listen command simply runs the queue:work --once command inside an infinite loop, this will cause the following:

An instance of the app is booted up on every loop.
The assigned worker will pick a single job and execute it.
The worker process will be killed.



php artisan queue:listen
php artisan queue:retry all
php artisan queue:work --tries=3
